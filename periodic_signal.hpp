/**
 * @brief the operation mode indicates how the delta times are computed in the PeriodicSignal
 *
 * with perfect detlas, when enough time has elapsed for a delta time to have occurred, then it's reported that the last
 * delta time is given by 1/freq, ie the exact period, and not the actual measured time, this is good for when you want
 * to be able to reliably use the same delta time over and over for stability in certain systems, one example is in
 * client prediction and server reconciliation to guarentee that both systems use the same delta time to keep their
 * results similar
 *
 * measured deltas are exactly what they sound like and report how much time has actually passed since the last time the
 * periodic signal was checked and was ready to emit the signal

 * implementation, in the old implementation everything was based off the last time and it would have  error building up
 * over time, with the new implemenation everything is thought of as a timeline, and the "ticks" are laid out before
 * hand, we just sample the clock and figure out which tick we are in, which has shown to be more accurate.
